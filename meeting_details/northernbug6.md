NorthernBUG is a [Genetics Society](http://www.genetics.org.uk) meeting funded as a sectional interest group, with additional funding from **The Leeds Industry Academy** and [Leeds OMICS](http://www.leedsomics.org/).  It is a user group not a conference so the format will be a little more fluid than just presentations. The meeting will be composed of talks, discussions, and posters, but extended informal discussions of topics and challenges to all of us will be promoted.

# Agenda

Registration is from 9:30 onwards in University House (see [Location](#Location) ) We will have coffee. There will then be an optional pre-meeting workshop from 10-12 on ChIP-seq analysis (all are welcome, if you'd like to attend this select *Whole day* when registering).  Main arrival, coffee, and lunch from 12.
