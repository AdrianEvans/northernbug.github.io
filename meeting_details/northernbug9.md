# General

NorthernBUG 9 will be held at the University of Bradford on Friday 21st January 2022, starting at 12pm with lunch and finishing at 5pm, followed by drinks at a local pub.

The meeting will take place at **Norcroft Conference Centre 9 Tumbling Hill St, Bradford BD7 1DB.** 

Coming to the meeting by public transport is strongly recommended and the conference centre is a short walk from both Bradford Foster Square and Interchange rail and bus station.

We're looking for a range of:
- 10 minute talks (if you would like to talk for longer please just let us know).
- Posters accompanied by a 1-2 minute teaser talk. These are great for those who might be earlier on in their bioinformatics journey!


If anyone would like to fill any of these slots please contact [Amber Leckenby](mailto:A.Leckenby@bradford.ac.uk) and please extend the invite around your lab/department etc!
