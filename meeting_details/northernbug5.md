# General

NorthernBUG 5 will be held at the University of Hull on Monday 9th September 2019, starting at 12pm with lunch and finishing at 5pm. There will be a trip to a local pub afterwards, allowing drinks, further conversation and food if you wish.

This is of course a user group not a conference so the format will be a little more fluid than just presentations. The meeting will be composed of talks, discussions, and posters, but extended informal discussions of topics and challenges to all of us will be promoted.

# Presentations and Posters
As at the last meeting we encourage people presenting posters to also give a 1 minute teaser talk. These are great for those who might not be ready to give a full talk but would like to advertise their topic and get as many people as possible coming to discuss their poster. Details on the 1 minute teaser talks will be circulated later.

Please volunteer to talk. We will have 15 minute presentations. We will attempt to distribute talks to ensure a diversity of speakers, so please volunteer whatever your career stage.

If anyone would like to fill any of these talk/poster slots please fill out the [Google form](https://forms.gle/HYRxY57HiSrrzBTZ7)

# Agenda

The agenda of talks will appear here closer to the event. Lunch will begin at 12, there will be a coffee break at approx 3pm, and concluding remarks at 5pm.

# Registration

There is an Eventbrite [registration for NorthernBug5-Hull](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/northern-bug5-hull-tickets-65795822075)

# Getting to the meeting
The meeting will take place in the Kingsley Suite of the Canham Turner building, on the campus of the University of Hull, Hu6 7RX.

If you are coming in at the main university entrance on Cottingham road then just keep walking straight ahead through the main grassy square. When you go through the last arch and can walk no further you will have hit the Canham Turner building.

If you need a parking permit, please put it on the Eventbrite registration or contact the organising team well ahead. There are very regular buses from the train station to campus (numbers 103, 105, 5, please check though) and public transport is a good option. Similarly, taxis from the train station are relatively cost effective.

Drinks after the main BUG will be at Larkin's 48 Newland Ave, Hull HU5 3AE
Its about 15 minutes walk from the Uni.
It serves decent beer, and also food. Its on a bus route to the station. There is some, but not a lot, of parking close by.
