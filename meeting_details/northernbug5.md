# General

NorthernBUG 5 will be held at the University of Hull on Monday 9th September 2019, starting at 12pm with lunch and finishing at 5pm. There will be a trip to a local pub afterwards, allowing drinks, further conversation and food if you wish.

This is of course a user group not a conference so the format will be a little more fluid than just presentations. The meeting will be composed of talks, discussions, and posters, but extended informal discussions of topics and challenges to all of us will be promoted.

# Presentations and Posters
As at the last meeting we encourage people presenting posters to also give a 1 minute teaser talk. These are great for those who might not be ready to give a full talk but would like to advertise their topic and get as many people as possible coming to discuss their poster. Details on the 1 minute teaser talks will be circulated later, but in short its 1 minute, 1 slide, and do not try to summarise 3 years of work, just the 'elevator pitch'.

Talks are mostly 20 minutes, so approximately 15 + 5mins discussion.

# Agenda
There will be a pre-meeting from 11-12 to discuss the funding from the Genetics Society and other topics. The agenda for this meeting has been posted on the Google Groups page. All are welcome at this meeting, just turn up.

# Registration

There is an Eventbrite [registration for NorthernBug5-Hull](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/northern-bug5-hull-tickets-65795822075)

# Getting to the meeting
The meeting will take place in the Kingsley Suite of the Canham Turner building, on the campus of the University of Hull, Hu6 7RX.

If you are coming in at the main university entrance on Cottingham road then just keep walking straight ahead through the main grassy square. When you go through the last arch and can walk no further you will have hit the Canham Turner building.

## Parking
We are sorting out parking permits for everyone (but it is taking a while). If you need a parking permit, please put it on the Eventbrite registration or contact the organising team. 

## Buses
There are very regular buses from the train station to campus (numbers 103, 105, 5, please check though) and public transport is a good option. Similarly, taxis from the train station are relatively cost effective.

# Post meeting pub
Drinks after the main BUG will be at Larkin's 48 Newland Ave, Hull HU5 3AE
Its about 15 minutes walk from the Uni.
It serves decent beer, and also food. Its on a bus route (and about 25 mins walk) to the station. There is some, but not a lot, of parking close by.
