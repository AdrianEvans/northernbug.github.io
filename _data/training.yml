- title: Statistical Analysis of Biological Data in R
  subtitle: Using R for the analysis of biological data
  description: This course provides a refresher on the foundations of statistical analysis. The course is aimed at scientists at all levels â€“ especially those whose formal education likely included statistics, but who have not perhaps put this into practice since. The focus of the course is on understanding the principles behind statistical testing, how to choose and execute the most appropriate test for your data, and how to interpret the result.

- title: Introduction to Practical Bioinformatics
  subtitle: This intensive two-day course aims to introduce scientists to the command-line interface and the R programming environment.
  description: Day 1 begins with an introduction to the Linux command-line, covering essential core utilities before moving on to introduce command-line BLAST and shell scripting.

Day 2 further develops shell scripting skills, then moves on to introduce data handling in the R statistical programming environment.

We start from the basics without assuming any prior knowledge.

- title: RNA-Seq Data Analysis
  subtitle: This one-day course covers important aspects of Bioinformatics and the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data.
  description: We work though an RNA-Seq Analysis example using Salmon for quantification, and the popular DESeq2 package for differential gene expression analysis.

- title: Interpreting RNA-Seq Results
  subtitle: This one-day course looks at several ways of adding functional context to lists of genes.
  description: We begin by introducing methods for clustering and visualizing data, including dendrograms, heatmaps and venn diagrams. We then consider how to make use of functional annotation that has been added to the gene databases of many organisms to examine gene lists for classes of annotation that are statistically over-represented.
